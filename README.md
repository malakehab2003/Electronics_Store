# Electronics Store

## Our Story
  When we asked for PPortfolio Project we thought that there is no project better than electronics Project because:
  
     1. utilizes what we have learned from the alx full-stack curriculum
     
     2. available on most devices
     
     3. require only basic functionality (CRUD Operations)
     
     4. include interactions with real clients, which required us to consider UI/UX design
     
     5. Specifying electronics only made our database well defined
     
  So immediately we stared Brainstorming for Basic Idea, Design, Roles, Requirements
  
  Then Defining Tasks Assigning tasks to Members 
  
  After that Programming the basic functionality and Testing
  
  Finally finishing the advanced functionality and system testing
