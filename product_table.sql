It features the Audio-Technica AT897 phantom-/battery-powered shotgun microphone, a furry windshield, a universal shoe/pole shockmount, a pistol grip, an aluminum cabled boompole, a boompole bag, and short and long right-angled XLR cables to provide you with everything necessary for capturing audio for video, film, and sound design applications. Well suited for indie films, nature recording, and documentary projects, the Audio-Technica AT897 shotgun microphone features smooth on-axis tone and great off-axis sound rejection while its housing remains short enough for camera-mounted operation. Plus, it can be operated via phantom power or a battery for flexible compatibility. The AT897\'s moderate sensitivity delivers optimal performance when paired with high-gain, low-noise microphone preamps. With a selectable low-cut filter at 80 Hz, the AT897 is capable of delivering clear sound while attenuating rumble and bass buildup. Plus, its full-spectrum frequency response utilizes a gentle increase in high frequencies to enhance intelligibility. The durable housing ensures rugged dependability while maintaining a light weight that won\'t burden your boompole or camera, and the included accessories accommodate mounting the AT897 to a mic stand, boompole, or camera-mount microphone holder. The Auray DUSM-1 Universal Shockmount features a four-point suspension to accommodate shotgun and other cylindrical microphones measuring 0.74-0.98\" (19-25mm) in diameter. The shockmount is easily angled with its rubberized adjustment knob. There is a built-in shoe for camera mounting, and a 3/8\"-16 thread connection at the base mounts the shockmount to boompoles and universal handgrips. The Auray WSS Series Professional Windshield delivers superior 360° wind protection with acoustic transparency. They are engineered for dramatic reduction of unwanted broadband wind noise and vocal pops with very little high frequency loss, for exceptionally accurate recordings. This WSS-2014 Professional Windshield has an inside depth of 5.5\" and is designed for use with many shotgun microphones. It features a specially manufactured open-cell foam matrix surrounded by a layer of 25mm thick simulated rabbit fur. This diffusion technology lowers wind velocity in a controlled air space around the microphone, thereby reducing wind noise without muffling the sound. It also features an airtight tapered rubber base that seals out wind from the rear of the microphone, greatly improving isolation and rear wind protection. When used on a shotgun microphone, this slip-on windshield is effective in minimizing wind noise and plosive sounds. It is most effective in light breeze to strong breeze conditions (4 to 25 mph) and users can generally expect a 24 to 40 dB reduction in wind noise with negligible dampening of high frequencies. For most applications, the negligible high-frequency dampening is a worthwhile exchange for the dramatic wind noise reduction. In addition to superior 360° wind protection, the WSS-2014 helps prevent moisture and dirt from damaging your microphone. The windscreen is designed to fit microphones from Audio-Technica, Neumann, Røde, Sanken, Sennheiser and others. The WSS-2014 Professional Windshield for Shotgun Microphones is an advanced solution for outstanding wind protection with acoustic transparency. Designed to accommodate electronic news gathering (ENG), electronic field production (EFP), documentary, and other field recording applications, the Auray BP-47A Aluminum Telescoping Boompole with Internal Cable offers a sturdy and lightweight solution for getting a microphone optimally close to the subject without entering the picture frame, letting you work fast and minimize fatigue. Plus, its coiled internal XLR cable, high-quality connectors, and bottom-exit configuration deliver reliable signal transfer and easy setup. This BP Series boompole features four sections that smoothly telescope to provide adjustable reach from 2.5 to 7.5 feet. Thanks to the ergonomic twist locks and anti-twist alignment, the BP-47A is easily expanded or collapsed with a single turn. Durable aluminum construction keeps the weight down, ensuring a great combination of dependability and portability. The inclusion of a custom removable tip and drop-through design allows the BP-47A to support fast solderless cable replacement, so the shoot won\'t be delayed even if a cable or connector malfunctions. The black Kopul Premium Performance 3000 Series XLR M to Angled XLR F Microphone Cable (20\') is designed to be an extremely quiet and flexible cable that is ideal for the most demanding live sound and performance applications. The cable is engineered to be durable and to provide protection against EMI, RFI, and static noise. Premium Performance 3000 Series cables are made from 24 AWG OFC copper wire that\'s wrapped with PE insulation and a conductive PVC inner shield. A cotton-yarn inner layer helps reduce electrostatic and microphonic noise. 95% dual-spiral shielding makes the cable resistant to EMI and RFI noise. The Neutrik XX silver connectors provide a high level of connectivity, and all the solder connections are shrink-wrapped for protection.

The Auray Neoprene Boompole Bag for 34\" Closed Boompole with Shotgun Mic and Softie is a case designed to hold up to a 34\" closed boompole with shotgun microphone, softie, and shock mount. Its interior end cap is strengthened to protect the bag from punctures. It features a zipper closure with protective interior lining to prevent snags and scratches. The bag is built with an interior pocket for accessories that opens or closes with hook and loop fasteners. An adjustable shoulder strap is included with a nametag holder. The Auray Universal Microphone Pistol Grip is a handheld grip that features an ergonomic cushioned handle. This grip is great in \"run & gun\" situations in which a boom pole would be cumbersome, and in video scenarios in which the cameraman is also responsible for audio recording. The grip can be held with one hand, as opposed to a boom pole which requires two. It also provides the option of being able to record audio from a different direction than the camera is pointing, an advantage over camera mounting the mic. Furthermore, having the mic mounted off the camera prevents it from picking up motor noise from the lens focusing. In addition, the grip features standard 3/8\" threads on both ends. This allows you to attach your shotgun mic (with shockmount) to one end of the grip and mount the other end to a boom pole. This gives you the flexibility of being able to quickly detach the pistol grip and the attached shotgun mic from the boom, an option that can come in handy for entering areas that are too small for a boom pole.','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2500x2500/1612894284_821183.jpg','true','False',1818.69,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',271,6),(170,'Bretford AV Notebook & Projection Cart','Opposite positioning of the shelves results in unhindered use of equipment','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2000x2000/1321016366_827636.jpg','False','False',540.93,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',238,NULL),(171,'Magik Attachable Armrest Pad Desk Computer Table Arm Support Mouse Pads Arm Wrist, Size: 29, Black','Item Material: Strong ABS Plastic','https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTDTDsNKTjipYReCL5WdlXOZS7cPzB9SdoN0ifkWmqqYvmQPvBm8Nx-KdZQ_uBL41MFhtVyAsBPKkTbvjcFwaWUMBv8DQr4pA&usqp=CAY','False','False',12.12,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',333,NULL),(172,'Mobile Edge ScanFast Checkpoint Friendly Briefcase 2.0 (Black)','Exterior Material: Sorona','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2000x2000/1321879196_829041.jpg','true','False',99.99,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',93,6),(173,'Tiffen 82mm Variable Neutral Density Filter','Tiffen, a leader in the filter industry, proudly makes its filters in the USA and backs up its products with a solid 10-year warranty','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2500x2500/1658914600_821128.jpg','true','False',153.99,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',240,6),(174,'Tiffen 62mm Variable Neutral Density Filter','Tiffen, a leader in the filter industry, proudly makes its filters in the USA and backs up its products with a solid 10-year warranty','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2500x2500/1647425714_821125.jpg','true','False',92.36,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',240,6),(175,'Mobile Edge The ECO Messenger Bag (Olive)','Cotton Canvas','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2000x2000/1321878429_828987.jpg','true','False',44.44,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',93,6),(176,'Tiffen 52mm Variable Neutral Density Filter','Tiffen, a leader in the filter industry, proudly makes its filters in the USA and backs up its products with a solid 10-year warranty','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2500x2500/1647425714_821123.jpg','true','False',159.75,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:49',240,6),(177,'Tiffen 72mm Variable Neutral Density Filter','Tiffen, a leader in the filter industry, proudly makes its filters in the USA and backs up its products with a solid 10-year warranty','https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images2500x2500/1527070912_821127.jpg','true','False',87.58,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:49','2024-03-20 22:21:50',240,6),(178,'Lenovo ThinkPad Essential Wireless Mouse','Connect compatible Lenovo devices with just 1 nano receiver.','https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2593/1446/products/4X30M56887-01.jpg?v=1703091803','False','False',21.9,'USD','2024-03-20 22:21:50','2024-03-20 22:21:50',39,NULL),(179,'Cotton Carrier Universal Hubless Adapter Plate','Features:The Cotton Carrier to UNIVERSAL HUBLESS ADAPTER PLATE allows you to use your Cotton Carrier Camera System with any quick release tripod mount.

The SilentPA allows up to 16 transmitters to broadcast, each on a unique frequency, to an unlimited number of receivers; the listeners can then tune into the program they wish to listen to. This could be different bands performing simultaneously in the same hall, a house of worship broadcasting their sermon in different languages, or a backyard concert in a crowded neighborhood. The SilentPA Receiver includes two 1/8\" stereo outputs, so it\'s easy to monitor the program and record it on a separate recording device. The IE-9 Professional In-Ear Stereo earphones have a rugged metal housing with a single high-output driver in each ear to deliver remarkable loud and clear sound. The VocoPro SilentPA-TX is multichannel bodypack transmitter with lavalier microphone that works with SilentPA-RX wireless audio receivers. Listeners use the bodypack receivers (available separately) to tune into the audio program from the transmitter. The system can be expanded to allow up to 16 transmitters to broadcast, each on a unique frequency, to an unlimited number of receivers—at a range of up to 150\'. The SilentPA is well suited to a wide variety of applications including guided tours and educational needs, houses of worship that broadcast in different languages, multiple presenters or performers working simultaneously in the same venue, and more. The transmitter features a 3.5mm stereo line input and a mini-XLR mic input for the included lavalier mic, allowing you broadcast both music and vocals simultaneously. The level control is for the sum of the two inputs; to change the blend, you\'ll have to lower the music input at the source. Two AA batteries power the unit for approximately 4 hours, while the USB port lets you simultaneously use the transmitter and charge rechargeable batteries (not included); just connect the included USB cable to a power adapter or power bank (adapter and bank available separately).

What\'s worse, no one -- including Robin or his family -- believes Steven when he accuses the seemingly harmless Chip of being a malevolent menace.

Double aged, it first rests in American oak casks for several years before it\'s finished in French oak cognac barrels for 4-6 months. Boasting a wonderful balance of soft and unique flavors of vanilla, red fruit, and cinnamon, it\'s one of the best representations of 1800 Tequila\'s roots. A very special expression, it comes in a slender tall bottle with a purple top – the color of royalty. Launched in 1975 as a premium tequila brand, 1800 Tequila was first known as Cuervo 1800 Tequila. Today, it’s imported and distributed by the Beckmann family’s Proximo Spirits that also owns Jose Cuervo tequila. 1800 Tequila is a 100% blue agave tequila produced and bottled in Jalisco, Mexico. All their expressions come in the signature trapezoidal shaped bottles, reminiscent of Mayan pyramids, with the top designed as a shot glass.
